Last Christmas, I Gave You My Heart But The Very Next Day, You Gave It Away.

This Year, To Save Me From Tears I'll Give It To Someone Special.

Once Bitten And Twice Shy I Keep My Distance, But You Still Catch My Eye.

Tell Me, Baby, Do You Recognise Me? Well, It's Been A Year, It Doesn't Surprise Me. 

"Happy Christmas," I Wrapped It Up And Sent It With A Note Saying, "I love you,".

I Meant It Now I Know What A Fool I've Been But If You Kissed Me Now, I Know You'd Fool Me Again.
